        <h1>How to Meditate</h1>
        <p>Meditation is simpler (and harder) than most people think. Read these steps, make sure you’re somewhere where you can relax into this process, set a timer, and give it a shot:</p>
        <hr>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Take a seat</h2> 
                <p>Find place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Set a time limit</h2> 
                <p>If you’re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Notice your body</h2>
                <p>You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can kneel—all are fine.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2Feel your breath</h2> 
                <p>Follow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Notice when your mind has wandered</h2> 
                <p>Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to noticing that your mind has wandered—in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes—simply return your attention to the breath.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Be kind to your wandering mind</h2> 
                <p>Don’t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come back. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Close with kindness</h2> 
                <p>When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>That’s it! That’s the practice.</h2> 
                <p> You focus your attention, your mind wanders, you bring it back, and you try to do it as kindly as possible (as many times as you need to).</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
