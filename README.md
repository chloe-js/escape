Strategy Plane:

Business goals?
The Site owner's goal is to teach users specific body/mind self-improvement techniques

Why are we special?  
There are several other yoga and meditation sites such as 'Head Space' and you tube where the user can search for any type of yaoga or meditation video they want.
Our advantage is that we take the thinking out of dearching for a video and limiting choices for the best videos avalable and displaying it in a mobile friendly, visually apealing site.

Tech considerations?
Building for mobile demographic makes our site more accessable for the user at any time as meditation can often be needed in a stressful situation, the user may not have the time to get a computer.

Why would a user want this?
We not only ooffer the links to videos but also an opportunity to socialise and meet up with a community of like minded individuals. w=We connect users with the choice to come into the studio by contacting the studio and setting up a consultation or to enquire more on yago and meditation time tables.

Who is my target audience?
Target audience are customers that are looking to learn muay thai/self-defence, get fit and lose weight.

When you go to a particular site, where do you go first?
Existing customers want to see contact info, schedule times and contact info. New users want to be engaged immediately but also be able to see where price and location is. Muay thai is very niche so a FAQ section may also proof to be beneficial

Why do you go there in particular?
To check opening times, schedule, contact, location and prices

What makes a good experience?
Ease of access to information needs to be paramount which means a simple site structure. To attract new users to join, the site needs to be catchy and engaging from the jump.

What's worth doing?
