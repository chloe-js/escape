# project name - 'my-happy-place'
## using mind and body self-improvement techniques

The purpose of this project is to Build a Meditation/Mindfulness/Yoga Website. The External user’s site goal is for users that are interested in learning body/mind self-improvement techniques and the Site owner's goal is to teach users specific body/mind self-improvement techniques.

UX
The UX for this project will be investigated through the following five planes:
Strategy Plane:

Business goals?
The Site owner's goal is to teach users specific body/mind self-improvement techniques

Why are we special?  
There are several other yoga and meditation sites such as 'Head Space' and you tube where the user can search for any type of yaoga or meditation video they want.
Our advantage is that we take the thinking out of dearching for a video and limiting choices for the best videos avalable and displaying it in a mobile friendly, visually apealing site.

Tech considerations?
Building for mobile demographic makes our site more accessable for the user at any time as meditation can often be needed in a stressful situation, the user may not have the time to get a computer.

Why would a user want this?
We not only ooffer the links to videos but also an opportunity to socialise and meet up with a community of like minded individuals. w=We connect users with the choice to come into the studio by contacting the studio and setting up a consultation or to enquire more on yago and meditation time tables.

Who is my target audience?
Target audience are users that are interested in learning body/mind self-improvement techniques from the convience of their home.

What's worth doing?
adding links to yoga and meditation videos. 
Meditation How to, details on preparing self for a guided meditation.
creating a form to be submitted with user information to contact the studio for a consultation or to enquire more about the studio yoga and meditation classes.
keeping the site minimal and clean to keep the user in a state of calm while using the site.
keeping a neatral light and calm colour pallet to instill a sense of calm for the user.

Will it add value, and what value will it add? Who's our target audience? Who is our demographic, or our demographics?
Our target audience is most likely females aged from 25-35 entering into full time work with stressful jobs which limits the amount of time spent on themselves and creates a highly stressed and sleep deprived user.  having calming feminan color pallet puts the user at ease for the end of the day. short yoga videos and meditation techniques prepare the user to be one click away from 'their happy place'. Also encoraging a meet up or consultation session give the user a sense of community and normality, that there is someone there who will listen if needed and there is a place that they can feel comfortable to escape to if nessesary.


Scope Plane:

Whats on the table?
Most important features at this stage in no particular order are as follows:

    Contact info,
    Home navigation,
    How to meditate,
    Meet up contact,
    Links to videos,

Having a calming relaxing home page is the first thing the user will see when opening our site. this should be a warm and welcoming front page, I would like to keep with a rounded edge theme and limiting sharp or hard edges on my images as it is a lot more relaxing style choice. but having more then one image as a circle can be tricky esecially when there are 3 objects involved. I have need to do something else other then float in order to achieve this. 
I have chosen to go with flex box to help with the alignment and responsivness of my opening page as it gives me a must more flexible layout options.

![Flex box for 3 object placement](./assests/images/flex-box-circle-image.jpg)


Want to offer a hover over feature on gallery images so that when a user puts cursor over image, the image will expand taking up full page. Not hugely important so will wait and see how we progress.

Streetview tour while it may look impressive is not something that is currently important or feasible however may be the next step in project evolution and user engagement.

In addition, gym has merchandise (shorts, gloves jerseys) that it wants to advertise and sell online. Again, not deemed important or feasible at present but may be an additional feature at a later dates

User story/s:

    As a new member I want to know if joining a Muay Thai gym is for me.

    As new member I want to make an informed decision if this gym is the right choice.

    As a new user I want to know where the gym is.

    As a new user I want to know what time the classes are on.

    As a new user I want to know what is the pricing involved.

    As a new user I want to know what the contact information is for any follow up questions.

    Secondly (but just as important) the user wants to know if joining the gym is going to be worth doing, therefore the site needs to be engaging immediately highlighting the fun, toughness and dedication it takes to train muay thai. Also highlighting what Muay thai is.

    As an existing member I want to know what the schedule times are.

    As an existing member I want to know what the opening hours are.

    As an existing member I want to know what the contact information is.

    As an existing member I am on the go and have a million and one different commitments. Therefore when I come to site it will most likely be on mobile.

    When I come to the site, all this information needs to be easily obtainable.



Structure Plane:

Information architecture:
To keep our navigation minimal we will have 4 pages 

Home > Gallery > Contact

Principles of Organization:

    Currently stands that users to be engaged as soon as they come to site is main priority. Implementation of 5 second rule.
    Also want to show entire site map as soon as user comes on through nav bar and anchor drop links on homepage.
    Why do muay thai will serve as the about us and will show above the fold.
    Schedule/Pricing is a commonly used segment so will be placed in middle of homepage.
    FAQs will primarily be focused on new users.
    Testimonials will show towards bottom of page. Even though important want to use as reinforcement of users decision to join.
    Footer will contain map showing location, business contact info and social media links.
    Gallery and Contact Us are easily accessible.


Surface plane:

Font: Will be a mix of “Alice” and “Sacramento” a good paring suggesion from 'https://www.pagecloud.com/blog/best-google-fonts-pairings' for comparable and complementary fonts

Color: Primary color will be calm, feminine and relaxing. Secondary will be contrasted as bold but saturated to create a readable contrast for important items and the background will be complementary to both the primary and secondary colors. Color scheme was decided using 'https://coolors.co/77a6b6-373f47-dd7373-fbf2c0'. at irst test there was a contasting issue with the colors chosen but we have now changed the background color to creat more of a contract.
