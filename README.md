Strategy Plane:

Business goals?
The Site owner's goal is to teach users specific body/mind self-improvement techniques

Why are we special?  
There are several other yoga and meditation sites such as 'Head Space' and you tube where the user can search for any type of yaoga or meditation video they want.
Our advantage is that we take the thinking out of dearching for a video and limiting choices for the best videos avalable and displaying it in a mobile friendly, visually apealing site.

Tech considerations?
Building for mobile demographic makes our site more accessable for the user at any time as meditation can often be needed in a stressful situation, the user may not have the time to get a computer.

Why would a user want this?
We not only ooffer the links to videos but also an opportunity to socialise and meet up with a community of like minded individuals. w=We connect users with the choice to come into the studio by contacting the studio and setting up a consultation or to enquire more on yago and meditation time tables.

Who is my target audience?
Target audience are users that are interested in learning body/mind self-improvement techniques from the convience of their home.

What's worth doing?
adding links to yoga and meditation videos. 
Meditation How to, details on preparing self for a guided meditation.
creating a form to be submitted with user information to contact the studio for a consultation or to enquire more about the studio yoga and meditation classes.
keeping the site minimal and clean to keep the user in a state of calm while using the site.
keeping a neatral light and calm colour pallet to instill a sense of calm for the user.

Will it add value, and what value will it add? Who's our target audience? Who is our demographic, or our demographics?
Our target audience is most likely females aged from 25-35 entering into full time work with stressful jobs which limits the amount of time spent on themselves and creates a highly stressed and sleep deprived user.  having calming feminan color pallet puts the user at ease for the end of the day. short yoga videos and meditation techniques prepare the user to be one click away from 'their happy place'. Also encoraging a meet up or consultation session give the user a sense of community and normality, that there is someone there who will listen if needed and there is a place that they can feel comfortable to escape to if nessesary.


Surface plane:

Font: Will be a mix of “Alice” and “Sacramento” a good paring suggesion from 'https://www.pagecloud.com/blog/best-google-fonts-pairings' for comparable and complementary fonts

Color: Primary color will be calm, feminine and relaxing. Secondary will be contrasted as bold but saturated to create a readable contrast for important items and the background will be complementary to both the primary and secondary colors. Color scheme was decided using 'https://coolors.co/77a6b6-373f47-dd7373-fbf2c0'. at irst test there was a contasting issue with the colors chosen but we have now changed the background color to creat more of a contract.
